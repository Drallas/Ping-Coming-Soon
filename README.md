## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process
This site is built with a Mobile First approach, using **VSCode** and **Adobe XD** to look at the provided design templates.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM (at least tried)
- Vanilla JavaScript (75% Stitched together pieces from the Web)

### What I learned

It's harder than i thought to build a responsive website from even a 'simple' Frontendmentor.io design, its also more time-consuming to make it all look and feel like as specified. 

### Continued development

I have watched too much tutorials and occasionally i have built small web projects  / components for fun. To really improve my skills i need to start building Frontendmentor.io challenges on almost al daily bases. Tutorials make the time pass by slow, when building something i completely forget about the time.

HTML feels simple, but CSS is much harder than i thought, there are so many options and different ways to do the same thing. What i lack is consistent experience build Web Project especially with CSS and JavaScript is still struggle. 

### Useful resources

- [Build 20 mini frontend projects from scratch with HTML5, CSS & JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/) - Helped me to get the email error validation to work.
- [Ecosia](www.ecosia.org) - I used mostly Ecosia search to figure out more when i was stuck.
